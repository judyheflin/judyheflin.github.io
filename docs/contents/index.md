!!! quote ""

    I use “technical” in the broadest sense of the term,
    meaning someone who is highly interested in technique, defined as the
    procedures involved in completing a complicated task. This doesn’t
    necessarily mean the task must be scientific or technological. The
    technique I speak of applies equally to the mathematics of graph
    theory and the practicalities of throwing a clay pot. An artist and an
    engineer are equally technical. [^1]
